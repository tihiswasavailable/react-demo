# **React-demo**
Welcome to my Hello World React project! This project is designed to demonstrate basic React concepts.

## **Project structure**
The project is structured as follows:
- **App.js** - the main React component which is the entry point of the application. It renders the `HelloWorld` component.
- **index.js** - the main file which renders the `App` component in the DOM.
- **TodoList.js** - a simple component

## **Requirements**
- **Node.js**
- **npm**

## **Setup the project**
First you need to **install Node.js**. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```bash
npm install

//or

npm update
```
After that, you can **create a new React application** in a **new directory** using the following command:
```bash
npx create-react-app react-demo
````
**Navigate to the created directory:**
```bash
cd react-demo
```
**Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tihiswasavailable/react-demo.git
```
### **Running the application**
To run the application, you need to use the following command:
```bash
//for development
npm start 

//for production
npm run build 
```
The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
